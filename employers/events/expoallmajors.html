If your organization is registered for the event and no one                    shows up, your organization is expected to pay the balance due. Failure to pay event fees will cause us to block your organization from utilizing any                  services available through our office until the matter is cleared. Registration fees cannot be applied to future events.</p>
                  <p>Should you have to cancel, please call the Auburn University Career Center office as soon as possible at (334) 844-3862 and ask to speak with Diane                    Thorne, Special Events Registration Manager.

Diane will send you an e-mail confirming your cancellation. It is important to keep a copy of this                  communication as documentation for future reference.</p>

                    <h6><strong><a id="exhibitor"></a>Exhibitor Guidelines</strong></h6>
                    <p>Decorations, signs, and posters must be coordinated with HAUDCC staff prior to displaying in the Conference Center.                      No tacks, nails, staples, tape or other fasteners are allowed. Exhibitors are liable for any defacement of the facility as a                    result of their display!</p>
                    <p>The exhibitor is entirely responsible for the space leased by him/her and is responsible for keeping space free from any                      conditions which would be dangerous to persons coming upon the premises.</p>
                    <p>The management of HAUDCC reserves the right to restrict the operation of any exhibit, which in its opinion detracts                      from the general character of the facility. This includes, but is not limited to, exhibits, which because of noise, flashing light,                  methods of operation or display of unsuitable material are determined by management as objectionable.</p>
                    <p>The Auburn University Career Center and The Hotel at Auburn University and Dixon Conference Center will not be                      responsible for any injury that may arise to exhibitors or their employees or for loss of or any damage to any good from                  any course whatsoever while in transit to or from or while in HAUDCC.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>We request your full cooperation in observing these guidelines. Anything not included in the rules and regulation                    will be subject to the discretion of Auburn University management.</em></strong></p>
