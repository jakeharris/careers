      <h6><a id="cancel"></a>Cancellation Policy</h6>
      <p>There are no refunds for cancellations after Friday, January 4, 2013! One half of the registration fee ($150.00) is charged for all cancellations prior to        the deadline date whether the registration fee is paid in advance or not. We would like for all participants in our programs (events) to pay the total        registration fee in full by the deadline date to keep your reservation. We understand that some might not be able to do this, so we are flexible in        working with you. Let us know in advance and we will be happy to accommodate you. If your organization is registered for the event and no one        shows up, your organization is expected to pay the balance due. Failure to pay event fees will cause us to block your organization from utilizing any      services available through our office until the matter is cleared. Registration fees cannot be applied to future events.</p>
      <p>Should you have to cancel, please call the Auburn University Career Center office as soon as possible at (334) 844-3862 and ask to speak with Diane        Thorne, Special Events Registration Manager. An e-mail must be sent to Diane Thorne at thornde@auburn.edu explaining that you are officially        canceling your organization's participation in the event. Diane will send you an e-mail confirming your cancellation. It is important to keep a copy of this      communication as documentation for future reference.</p>
      <p>Please understand that once you have registered and received a confirmation, you must abide by the CANCELLATION POLICY. There are no<br>
        exceptions!! Any questions or concerns should be directed to Melvin K. Smith, Special Events Coordinator, (334) 844-4744 or mks@auburn.edu<br>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h6><a id="shipping"></a>Shipping to the Student Center</h6>
      <p>Shipments of exhibit displays, materials or anything pertaining to the exhibit may be shipped no sooner than three (3) days        prior to function date. Accommodations for packages needing to arrive earlier must contact Melvin K. Smith, Special        Events Coordinator, (334) 844-4744 or mks@auburn.edu for approval! Storage space is very limited. We will do our very      best to work with you!</p>
      <p>Please use our Preferred Carriers (Fedex and UPS) to ship materials! See the example of how each box or display        should be addressed for shipping to The Auburn University Student Center (AUSC). Your organization’s name is        required on the outside of all materials. Print off multiple pre-made labels) for your convenience (one (1) per box      or container to be shipped).</p>
      <p>Make sure the representative(s) attending the event have ALL tracking numbers of packages that have        been shipped to HAUDCC prior to arriving at the event. We highly recommend you insure ALL of your      materials shipped!</p>
      <p>On the day of the event, beginning at 8:00 am, representative(s) of your organization may go        to the Representative Registration Table in the Lobby outside of the 3rd Floor Ballroom of        the AUSC to pick-up your shipped materials. To receive the items from an Auburn        University Career Center staff member, a signature will be required from your      representative(s).</p>
      <p><img src="shippinglabelisjf.png" width="700" height="343"></p>
      <h6>Shipping from the Student Center</h6>
      <p>Patrons must make their own shipping arrangements, to include billing arrangements with the Preferred Carriers        (Fedex and UPS). The AUSC cannot provide billing arrangements, proper packing and labeling. The form must be filled      out completely with the organization’s account number!</p>
      <p>After the Part Time Job Fair: ALL boxes must be appropriately labeled and taped! Please take packages to the        Representative Registration Table in the Lobby outside of the 3rd Floor Ballroom of the AUSC where a member of the        Auburn University Career Center will be available to check-in your materials for shipping out. AUSC will make one call to      each preferred carrier for pick-up!</p>
      <p>Carriers used other than the Preferred Carriers (Fedex and UPS) should arrive by 1:00 pm no later than 2:00 pm to        pick-up materials at the Representative Registration Table in the Lobby outside of the 3rd Floor Ballroom of the AUSC the        day of the event. The representative(s) attending the event for the organization are responsible for making sure the      connection is made.</p>
      <p>Auburn University will not hold packages awaiting pick-up. If the organization’s representative(s) do not attend the event,        the organization is responsible for making arrangements to get their packages.</p>
      <h6>Exhibitors</h6>
      <p>Decorations, signs, and posters must be coordinated with AUSC staff prior to displaying in the Student Center. No tacks,        nails, staples, tape or other fasteners are allowed. Exhibitors are liable for any defacement of the facility as a result of their      display!</p>
      <p>The exhibitor is entirely responsible for the space leased by him/her and is responsible for keeping space free from any        conditions which would be dangerous to persons coming upon the premises.</p>
      <p>The management of the AUSC reserves the right to restrict the operation of any exhibit, which in its opinion detracts        from the general character of the facility. This includes, but is not limited to, exhibits, which because of noise, flashing light,      methods of operation or display of unsuitable material are determined by management as objectionable.</p>
      <p>The Auburn University Career Center and Student Center will not be responsible for any injury that may arise to        exhibitors or their employees or for loss of or any damage to any good from any course whatsoever while in transit to or      from or while in the AUSC.</p>
