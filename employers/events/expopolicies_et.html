  an Auburn University Career Center staff member, a signature will be required from your<br>
  representative(s).</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><strong class="orange">Shipping from the Event:</strong>   Patrons must make their own shipping arrangements, to include billing arrangements with the Preferred Carriers (Fedex and UPS). HAUDCC cannot provide billing arrangements, proper packing and labeling. The form must be filled out completely with the organization's account number!</p>
<p><span class="orange"><strong>After the Career Expo:</strong></span> ALL boxes must be appropriately labeled and taped! Please take packages to the Auditorium of HAUDCC where a member of the Auburn University Career Center will be available to check-in your materials for shipping out. HAUDCC will make one call to each preferred carrier for pick-up! </p>
