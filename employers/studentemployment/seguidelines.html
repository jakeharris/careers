            <h1>On-Campus Student Employment Guidelines</h1>
      <h6>Student Eligibility</h6>
      <p>Individuals meeting the following requirements are eligible for student employment:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enrolled in one or more semester hours at Auburn University</li>
        <li>Not enrolled for the current semester but enrolled for the previous semester and the following semester (ex: Student enrolled Spring and Fall but not enrolled Summer)</li></ol>
        
      <p>  <strong>Recent AU Grads:</strong> Students who wish to work on campus in the semester between graduation and the start of a new/graduate degree program must be hired as a TES (Temporary Employment Services) employee. (ex: Student graduates from Auburn University in May, registers for fall classes, and is not enrolled for summer classes, must work as a TES employee in the summer.)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Incoming Students:</strong> May begin work on-campus five business days prior to the start of classes. Prior to this time, incoming students who work on-campus must be employed through TES.</p>
      <p><strong>International Students: </strong>Immediately upon receiving a job offer, international students must go to the Office of International Programs (OIP) to be counseled on their work status. International students hold various types of visas, and to best protect these individuals, OIP will determine if the student is authorized to work. International students are allowed to work up to 20 hours per week (.50 FTE) for all jobs combined. (Students are permitted to work up to 40 hours per week (1.0 FTE) for all jobs combined in the summer and during breaks between semesters.)</p>
      <h6>Policy for Work Hours (On-Campus Jobs)</h6>
      <p><strong>Undergraduate Students</strong><br>
        Up to 20 hours per week (.50 FTE) for all campus jobs combined. (Students are permitted to work up to 40 hours per week (1.0 FTE) for all jobs combined in the summer and during breaks between semesters.)      </p>
      <p><strong>Graduate Students</strong><br>
        Up to 20 hours per week (.50 FTE) for all assistantships and other campus jobs combined. (Students are permitted to work up to 40 hours per week (1.0 FTE) for all jobs combined in the summer and during breaks between semesters.)<br>
        <strong><em>Note</em></strong>: An exception is automatically allowed in the special case of a graduate assistant assigned to teach one four credit course and one three/four credit course. In such cases, appointments will be made at .58/.67 FTE respectively. Other exceptions may be requested with compelling academic justification, in writing to the Provost by the academic dean.</p>
      <p>
      <h6>Student Eligibility and Work Hours (Off-Campus Jobs)</h6>
      <p>There are no enrollment requirements in order for students to work in off-campus positions. Students may work as many or as few hours as desired in off-campus positions. However, the Auburn University Career Center recommends that undergraduate students do not exceed 20 hour per week, especially when taking a full (14-17 hour) course load.</p>
      <p>Students should meet with the hiring manager/potential supervisor prior to accepting any position to discuss expectations regarding course load, work hours and scheduling during finals and breaks to ensure that they are able to maintain good academic standing while pursuing part-time employment.<br>
