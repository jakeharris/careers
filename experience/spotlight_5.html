     <h6>How did you find your internship?</h6>
     <p>I  found my internship online through the Disney interns website. I already had an  idea of the types of internships that were offered, but I went to the website  to apply for those that were specific to my major. I also completed a Disney  College Program before my internship with the Industrial Engineering  Department. It allowed me to work at Disney, take an engineering course, and  network with individuals who were industrial engineers.</p>
</div>
     <div style="width:100%; float:left;">
     <h6>Describe your internship experience and the responsibilities you had.</h6>
     <p>My internship experience was something that is  difficult to describe in words—because it was beyond my expectations! As a  professional intern with Industrial Engineering, I was placed under the role of  supporting Attractions across the Walt Disney World Property. Since my coach  (or mentor) was the lead industrial engineer for Magic Kingdom attractions, I  ended up focusing a great deal of my time there.<br>
       </p>
     <p>I was responsible for various  projects dealing with efficiency, capacity analysis, and guest counting  accuracy. Under the supervision of my coach, I was given projects which I could  lead myself. It was my responsibility to create a project plan, coordinate with  clients, execute a study using available resources, analyze the data, and  present the project to the clients. This allowed for the true experience of  what it was like to be working as an industrial engineer.<br>
       </p>
     <p>Also, during spring break season  (one of the busiest seasons for theme parks) I was responsible for providing  efficiency tips to various attractions. I would visit a few attractions each  day during their peak periods, and analyze what was done well in the operation  of the attraction, and where improvement might be found.</p>
     </div>
<div style="width:100%; float:left;">
     <h6>What did you enjoy most about your internship?</h6>
     <p>The freedom, responsibilities, and learning  opportunities are what I enjoyed most about my internship. I was given the  freedom to manage my own time and organize my day via an outlook calendar. This  allowed me to physically see my schedule and manage my time and resources  accordingly. I was also given responsibility for delivering in all aspects of a  project. I enjoyed being able to see a project from start to finish, and know  that it was my project—we were encouraged to take ownership for our work.  Finally, Disney was a big proponent of ongoing learning. I had the opportunity  to attend different informational meetings or to go to Disney University to  learn additional information that might be helpful in my field. </p>
</div>
<div style="width:100%; float:left;">
  <h6>What was the most difficult aspect of your internship?</h6>
  <p>The  most difficult aspect of my internship was communicating effectively and  concisely. I tend to be a talkative person, so I would tend to have wordy  e-mails when I could have more effectively displayed the information in a table  or in a few sentences. Communication is a skill which I feel is underestimated,  but it&rsquo;s always crucial. An individual in Industrial Engineering must be able  to communicate at all levels—from the frontlines up to executives.</p>
</div>
<div style="width:100%; float:left;">
  <h6>How did your experience at Auburn University prepare you for your internship?</h6>
      <p>Auburn prepared me for my internship by allowing  me the resources that I needed in order to be successful. Not only were a  number of my courses relevant to the work I was doing, but the interactions I  had with the Career Center allowed me to be better prepared for  what to expect, and how to ask the right questions. </p>
</div>
      <div style="width:100%; float:left;">
      <h6>How did your internship prepare you for a career?</h6>
      <p>Honestly,  my internship allowed me to sort of &ldquo;test drive&rdquo; my real life. I was living in  a condo, had a commute to work, and worked a regular &ldquo;8-5&rdquo; job. That in and out  of itself was an experience. The internship itself exposed me to the types of  tools, resources, and knowledge required to be successful in my field. I have a  greater understanding of what it means to be an industrial engineer, and what  the expectations are of a potential employer. In general, I feel significantly  more prepared for a career in industrial engineering after my internship.</p>
</div>
      <div style="width:100%; float:left; padding-bottom:10px;">
        <h6>What advice do you have for other Auburn students looking to gain experience while in college?</h6>
        <p>As funny as it may sound, I would recommend that  students go for their dreams. Once you find something that you are passionate  about, use all of the resources that Auburn makes available in order to go about  achieving your dream. Initially, I applied for the industrial engineering  internship and the college program at the same time. I did not get the IE  internship, but I decided to use my college program as a learning tool and a  networking opportunity. That, mixed with <u>many</u> visits to the career  center, gave me the leg up when I again applied for the IE internship. </p>
Even though Disney was always my 1st  choice, I went to the Career Expo and met with other employers and got myself  out there. The best thing you can do for yourself is to open as many doors as  possible.      </div>
      <div style="width:100%; float:left;">
        <h6>What are your career plans following graduation?</h6>
        <p>I  hope to return for another internship with Disney during Summer 2014, at which  point I will be able to interview for a full-time job there. It would be a  dream come true to work full-time with the Industrial Engineering Department at  Disney; however, like I said, I&rsquo;ll be sure to keep as many doors open as  possible.</p>
