      <h6><a name="overview"></a>What is an internship?</h6>
      <p>An internship is a professional  development opportunity that integrates practical career related experience  with postsecondary education in a structured, supervised work environment.</p>
      <p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>May be paid or unpaid (Department of Labor Guidelines)</li>
        <li>Typically one semester in length</li>
        <li>May be for class credit (consult  academic or faculty advisor for approval)</li>
        <li>Available year-round</li>
        </ul>
      <p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
<h6><a name="benefits"></a>What are the benefits of completing an internship?</h6>
      <p>Degree related work experience makes you more  marketable as a job candidate and allows you to gain greater understanding of  your career field. Employers feel more confident when hiring candidates who  have interned in their field, because they know the individual understands the  positives and negatives of the position in advance. </p>
      <p><strong>Additional benefits include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enhancing your resume </li>
        <li>Building your professional network</li>
        <li>Learning more about your chosen  industry or field</li>
        <li>Applying academic learning to hands-on  situations </li>
        <li>Becoming more knowledgeable about  general work functions </li>
        <li>Investigating organizational culture</li>
        <li>Developing transferable skills such as  effective communication, time management, report writing, and customer service</li>
        </ul>
      <p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
<h6><a name="finding"></a>How do I find an internship?</h6>
      <p><strong>Timeline</strong><br>
Begin your search three to four months  in advance of your desired start date.</p>
      <p><strong>Internship Postings</strong><br>
        The  web can be a great starting place to find internships. While applying online  does not completely replace face-to-face contact, many companies track  applicants through web-based systems. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.jobs.auburn.edu" target="_blank">Tiger Recruiting Link</a> is Auburn&rsquo;s job database for  connecting with employers and applying for positions.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.internships.com" target="_blank">Internships.com</a> allows you to access internship  postings from across the country.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.internmatch.com/" target="_blank">InternMatch.com</a> offers internship postings, primarily with non-profit and start-up companies across the country.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/undergrad_studies/career/resources/wrinternships.html" target="_blank">More links</a> to websites that assist in the search  for internships.</li>
        </ul>
      <p><strong>Career Expos &amp; Events</strong><br>
      Attend career events that put you in  direct contact with many potential employers. Don&rsquo;t ignore the power of  face-to-face contact in getting past the recruiter&rsquo;s stack of resumes and  landing an interview.</p>
      <p>Use <a href="http://www.jobs.auburn.edu/" target="_blank">Tiger  Recruiting Link</a> to see a list of employers attending each event and  send your resume to those you are most interested in meeting. Check out the <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/undergrad_studies/career/events/" target="_blank">Special  Events calendar</a> to see a list of career events, dates, locations, and  times.            </p>
      <p><strong>On-Campus Recruiting</strong><br>
      Some  employers visit Auburn to interview students for internships. This is great  because you don&rsquo;t have to travel or miss classes to interview with the company.  Use <a href="http://www.jobs.auburn.edu/" target="_blank">Tiger  Recruiting Link</a> to search for and apply to on-campus recruiting  positions as well as set up interview times. </p>
      <p><strong>Networking</strong><br>
        Talk with your major professors and  academic advisors to collect a list of contacts. They may know where former  students are currently employed and have their contact information. Use the <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/undergrad_studies/career/students/handbook.pdf" target="_blank">Career Handbook</a> to help you compose a Networking Letter introducing  yourself to the individual and explaining your career goals. Opening the lines  of communication can help lead to internship opportunities, but never openly  ask the person for a job. </p>
      <p><strong>Information Sessions</strong><br>
      Attend employer information sessions to  learn more about a company and the career opportunities available. Many  employers conduct information sessions prior to career expo or their on-campus  recruiting visit. A list of upcoming information sessions is available on <a href="www.jobs.auburn.edu" target="_blank">Tiger  Recruiting Link</a>.      </p>

      <h6><a name="foundit"></a>What do I do when I find an internship?</h6>
      <p>Congratulations!  Now that you have secured an internship experience it&rsquo;s time to cover your  bases at Auburn University. </p>
      <p><strong>Not for Academic Credit</strong><br>
        If you are completing your internship  during the summer semester and are not receiving course credit, in most cases,  you do not have to consult with the university or complete any forms. We do  encourage you to report your internship to Career Services through Tiger  Recruiting Link</p>
      <p>If you are completing your internship  during the fall or spring semesters and receive a scholarship or financial aid,  check with the scholarship provider and/or a financial aid representative to  complete any necessary delay of payment forms. (For example: General university  scholarships are managed by the Office of University Scholarships in the Quad  Center.) Also, meet with your academic advisor to discuss how your internship  will affect progress toward your degree.</p>
      <p>To make sure your health insurance  coverage remains active, check with your insurance provider and supply any  necessary documents they request.</p>
      <p><strong>For Academic Credit</strong><br>
        If you are receiving course credit for  your internship experience, consult with your faculty advisor or academic unit to  determine credit requirements. Each academic unit on campus handles credit for  internships individually. </p>
      <p>If you are receiving scholarships or  financial aid, check with your scholarship provider and/or a financial aid  representative to complete any necessary delay of payment forms. (For example:  General university scholarships are managed by the Office of University  Scholarships in the Quad Center.)</p>
      <p>To make sure your health insurance  coverage remains active, check with your insurance provider and supply any  necessary documents they request.</p>
      <p><strong>Reporting Your Placement</strong><br>
        Career Services is proud of your  success and wants to know about your internship placement. This information is  crucial in attracting more students and employers to campus. Also, you may be  able to help future students in obtaining internships or full-time jobs through  your professional network and connections!
