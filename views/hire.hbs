    <h2>This is Recruiting.</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Highly effective employers place their emphasis on long-term
      objectives and building connections with students, faculty, 
      and the career staff, rather than focusing on recruiting 
      transactions. It is the Career Center's goal to develop and 
      maintain strong relationships with employers, and we value 
      the opportunity to assist you with your hiring needs.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Your success is our success. We look forward to helping you 
      put a Tiger On Your Team.
