      Choosing a major and subsequent career path is one of the most important 
      decisions your student will make. Encourage him/her to take time to 
      reflect on his/her values, personality, skills, and interests. Your student
      can then narrow his/her focus when researching possible majors/careers. 
      Take a look at the links on the left for details about helping your student
      through this process. Having a clear picture of the path he/she will take 
      during his/her college career will better equip you to guide him/her through
      their time at Auburn.

      A strong academic record is no longer the main quality employers look for 
      in a potential employee. Experience outside of the classroom will help your
      student build the necessary skills to be successful in his/her desired career.
      Non-academic experience comes in many forms including part-time jobs, 
      internship, research, volunteer work, and campus leadership. Encourage your 
      student to pursue as many opportunities as possible. Those experiences will 
      help his/her resume stand out among a sea of fellow applicants.

      As parents of graduates facing a tough job market, what can you do to 
      assist your grad in transitioning from the secure world of classes and 
      residence halls to the unknown reality of what lies ahead? Ask how you 
      can assist him/her in their job search and suggest he/she visit the 
      Career Center for assistance. Help your new grad get his/her foot in 
      the door by providing networking contacts. These are just some of the 
      ways in which you can help him/her during the job search. Keep in mind 
      that he/she is trying to transition into the real world - let him/her 
      take the lead.
