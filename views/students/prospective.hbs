    <p>
      Once you've researched possible majors and career, 
      take the time to talk to people in those industries. 
      Want to know what a day in the life of a doctor, 
      accountant, engineer, public relations specialist, 
      etc. is like? Schedule a job shadowing experience 
      with a professional in your field of interest. You 
      could also schedule an informational interview. Ask 
      any lingering questions that you may have about a 
      career field when you interview a professional in 
      that area.
    </p>
    <p>  
      Once you have narrowed your focus, consider
      applying for a part-time job or internship in that 
      field. Experience a career first hand and build your 
      resume at the same time!
