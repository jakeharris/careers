    <h3>On-Campus Interviewing</h3>
    <p>
      On-campus interviewing (OCI) offers employers 
      the opportunity to screen candidates for further 
      consideration for positions within the 
      organization. Employers may choose from several 
      different recruiting models that offer varying 
      degrees of control over who you will interview 
      during your visit to Auburn.
