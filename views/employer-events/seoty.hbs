        As a part of National Student Employment Week, on Monday, April 11, 2016, the Career 
        Center hosts the Student Employee of the Year Awards (SEOTY). Two students are 
        awarded for their efforts as an on-campus or off-campus student employee, and all 
        nominees are recognized. Additionally, students submit nominations for Supervisor of
        the Year. The award recipients will move on to represent Auburn University at 
        regional and national levels of the National Student Employment Association awards.
