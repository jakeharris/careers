          As a part of National Student Employment Week, on Monday, April 11, 2016, the Career 
          Center hosts the Student Employee of the Year Awards (SEOTY). Two students are 
          awarded for their efforts as an on-campus or off-campus student employee, and all 
          nominees are recognized. Additionally, students submit nominations for Supervisor of
          the Year. The award recipients will move on to represent Auburn University at 
          regional and national levels of the National Student Employment Association awards.
