          You may <strong>only</strong> nominate your direct supervisor, and only 
          if you are a student employee.

          The National Student Employment Association (NSEA) designates one week each 
          year, National Student Employment Week, for universities and colleges 
          nationwide to recognize the substantial contributions of student employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recognition of National Student Employment Week, April 11-15, 2016, the 
          Career Center will host the Student Employee of the Year awards to recognize 
          student employees for their unwavering dedication to both the campus and 
          community. Supervisors nominate student employees to receive recognition for 
          both on and off campus service. Additionally, outstanding supervisors will be 
          recognized for their leadership and support of student employment. All 
          nominees will be recognized and one will be selected as Supervisor of the Year.
