    {
      "id": "housing",
      "question": "Where can I live?",
      "answer": "There are several summer housing options offered by D.C. area universities to interns from across the country. Additionally, there are several private housing options offered by organizations. To see a list of potential options, click the 'Back to Overview' button above, and look for the dropdown on the bottom left. While it does not contain a comprehensive list of all housing options, the options presented have been recommended by former interns. Many interns also choose to live with family members or friends in the D.C. area during their internship. Housing does book quickly and it is recommended that you reserve space soon after accepting your internship."
