        "Graduate students may hold multiple assistantships (assistantships and/or hourly employment) from one or more units on campus, but together the cumulative appointment should be 0.25, 0.33, or 0.50 FTE and cannot add up to more than a 0.50 FTE (20 hours per week) appointment. This allows the students the time needed to devote to their academic programs.",
        "An exception is automatically allowed in the special case of a graduate assistant assigned to teach one four credit course and one three/four credit course. In such cases, appointments will be made at .58/.67 FTE respectively. Concerning other exceptions, see the graduate assistant handbook."

Review the Last Work Date and note if it is blank or filled in.",
        "If the Home Department, Check Distribution, and District or Division are entered, and the Last Work Date is blank, the student is Active. The number of hours the student can work will need to be determined. Completing an ePAF form through Banner will add the new job.",
        "Otherwise, the student will be treated as a new hire (even if s/he is of Terminated status). They will need to fill out all of the necessary paperwork to work on-campus. This paperwork should be sent to the Human Resources department, which is off-campus, at 1550 East Glenn Avenue."
