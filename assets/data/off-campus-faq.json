      "question": "What is the difference between On-Campus Recruiting (OCR) and Non-OCR?",
      "answer": [
        "OCR describes jobs where employers visit campus to interview applicants in the AU Career Center or Office of Professional and Career Development offices. OCR postings will either be Pre-Select (the employer screens resumes and invites select applicants to interview) or Open (the employer does not screen applicants- qualified candidates can sign up for interviews without an invitation).",
        "Non-OCR jobs are those that will not have interviews conducted on Auburnâ€™s campus. Employers will contact candidates to set up interviews (phone or in person)."

      "answer": [
        "There are no enrollment requirements in order for students to work in off-campus positions. Students may work as many or as few hours as desired in off-campus positions. However, the Auburn University Career Center recommends that undergraduate students do not exceed 20 hour per week, especially when taking a full (14-17 hour) course load.",
        "Students should meet with the hiring manager/potential supervisor prior to accepting any position to discuss expectations regarding course load, work hours and scheduling during finals and breaks to ensure that they are able to maintain good academic standing while pursuing part-time employment."
