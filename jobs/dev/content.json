Thank the interviewer for his or her time and reiterate your specific interest in the position and company. A general rule of thumb is to send a thank you note to any company employee who spent more than 10-15 minutes with you. This may include an individual you gave you a tour of the facility or took you to lunch during the course of your interview. Remember to ask for business cards while on your interview so that you can have the individuals’ names and mailing information."
