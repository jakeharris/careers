For right now, we'll remove the "Particular majors" search bar, and swap to 
"College information" or something like that. Or "Career search guides". And 
we'll link simply to the liason pages for each of those colleges, until we have 
the information to populate them. 

Eventually, we'll want a bar each for "Career field info" or something like 
that, and "Search by Major" (with a search input) as bars part of the bottom nav.
